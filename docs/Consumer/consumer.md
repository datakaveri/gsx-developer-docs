# Introduction

The GDI Consumer APIs enable consumers to request and obtain tokens for accessing both OPEN and SECURE resources. Access information related to a resource can be accessed via the [Consumer Panel](https://catalogue.gdi.org.in/consumer).

## Registration

A new consumer can register for an account when prompted to log in at either the [Catalogue Panel](https://catalogue.gdi.org.in) or the [Consumer Panel](https://catalogue.gdi.org.in/consumer). Refer to [Registration](../registration.md) for instructions on how to register.

Once a consumer registers, they will be able to log into both the Catalogue Panel and the Consumer Panel. Additionally, they can obtain access tokens for data access via [APIs](https://dx.gdi.org.in/auth/apis#tag/Token-APIs/operation/post-auth-v1-token).
