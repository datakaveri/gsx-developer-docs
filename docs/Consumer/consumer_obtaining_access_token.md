# Obtaining Access Token
To access a resource after discovering from the catalogue, a consumer should obtain Access Token using GDI Authorisation Servers [Create Token APIs](https://dx.gdi.org.in/auth/apis#tag/Token-APIs/operation/post-auth-v1-token). 

A consumer can use the clientID and clientSecret obtained through [Registration](../registration.md)

**Note: There are two types of resources in GDI:**

1. **Public or Open**: Tokens for such resources can be generated by providing the resource_server ID as the item type.
2. **Restricted or Secure**: These resources require some kind of policy for access.

Ensure to use the appropriate resource server id as itemId to obtain a token.


```json
{
  "itemId": "geoserver.dx.gdi.org.in",
  "itemType": "resource_server",
  "role": "consumer"
}
```


## Obtaining token for a SECURE resource
After discovering a Secure resource from the Catalogue, a consumer can obtain a token using the [Create Token APIs](https://dx.gdi.org.in/auth/apis#tag/Token-APIs/operation/post-auth-v1-token) with the following request body. Ensure to use the appropriate resource id as itemId to obtain a token.
