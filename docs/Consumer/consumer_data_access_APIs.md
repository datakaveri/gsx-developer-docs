# Data Access through APIs
After [discovering](./consumer_data_discovery.md) resources and obtaining appropriate [access tokens](./consumer_obtaining_access_token.md), a consumer can use the [OGC APIs](https://geoserver.dx.gdi.org.in/api?f=html) and [STAC APIs](https://geoserver.dx.gdi.org.in/stac/api?f=html)

## STAC APIs
The **STAC API** is a specification for an interface that allows searching and accessing geospatial data using standardized metadata. It enables users to perform complex queries based on spatial, temporal, and other metadata attributes, making it easier to discover and retrieve geospatial assets. For more information visit [here](https://stacspec.org/en).

## Features APIs

The **Features API** is an OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) standard that provides an interface for accessing and querying geospatial features. The features include elements on the earth surface represented by geometries like point, line or polygon. For example location of airports, bus stops are mapped as points, road and railway network as lines and urban areas and agricultural lands as polygons. It allows users to perform operations such as filtering, sorting, and retrieving geospatial data based on various attributes, facilitating the integration and use of geospatial information in different applications. For more information visit [here](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/features/)

## Tiles APIs
The **Tiles API** is an OGC standard that provides an interface for accessing tiled geospatial data. It allows users to retrieve map tiles efficiently, facilitating the display of large geospatial datasets in map applications by dividing data into manageable, smaller tiles that can be loaded and rendered individually.
